# Irrigation System App


As a irrigation system which helps the automatic irrigation of agricultural lands without human intervention, system has to
be designed to fulfil the requirement of maintaining and configuring the plots of land by the irrigation time slots and the
amount of water required for each irrigation period.
The irrigation system should have integration interface with a sensor device to direct letting the sensor to irrigate based on
the configured time slots/amount of water.


## Instructions

To compile (also runs unit tests)

```
mvn package
```

## Database
```
This system uses MongoDB as the primary database. For MongoDB we have used MongoDB Atlas free tier with public access.
```

## Alert
```
The mail server configuration needs to be updated to send alert to system admin when irrigation controller service is not available
```

## To run it in local

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

....and navigate your browser to  http://localhost:8080/

To  add land post request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land

```JSON

    "code": "73732823y723899",
    "area": 2000,
    "landType": "Sandy",
    "agricType": "Rice farming"
}
```

To  edit land put request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land/{landId}

```JSON
{
    "code": "29388933",
    "area": 2000,
    "landType": "Clay Soil",
    "agricType": "Rice farming"
}
```

To  edit configure land post request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land/{landId}/configure

```JSON

    }
]
```
## How it works
```
After setting up the land and land configuration a task scheduler is run every seconds to check the 
land that is due for irrigation base on nextTimeSlot column in the land configuration table if found, the nextTimeSlot field is updated base on the intervalInDays value. 

Then irrigation schedule is created and executed by sending a request to Iot device to perform the irrigation using the IoTDeviceControllerService a mock implementation as been added to the solution to return random status of SUCCESSFUL,FAILED or NOTAVAILABLE.

If the service returns NOTAVAILABLE the service is retried until the allowed number of retries is exceed, if the status is still NOTAVAILABE then an  alert is sent to the admin to notify the admin of the service unavailability.  

```
